# Adil Madhani Elementum Movie API exercise
Assignment created for coding challenge during the Elementum Interview Process. Completed by Adil Madhani.

Using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript I created a page that would pull various movie data using The Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/).
Each movie has its own dedicated "card" including the movie's Title, Poster, and Overview as found on tmdb. The page also includes a sort feature found at the top, allowing the user to sort by Now Playing, Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming movies in descending order.

A live version can be found here: http://adilmadhani.design/elementum-tmdb/index.html.
